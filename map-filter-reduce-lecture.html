//~ * Map * ~

//TODO Together: Let's see a common approach we might have done in the past: our goal is to increase each element of an array by 1 [element + 1], then get an array back with those values

const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];
//
// var numbersAddOne = [];
//
// for (var i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
//     numbersAddOne.push(numbers[i] + 1);
// }
//
// console.log(numbersAddOne);  // [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]

//TODO Together: Now, let's achieve the same result with the first part of our lesson: the MAP method~

let numbersAddOne = numbers.map(number => number + 1);

console.log(numbersAddOne); // [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]


//TODO Together: Let's get all these restaurant names out of this array of objects with .map()!

// let nameList = favoriteRestaurants.map(function(restaurant){
//     return restaurant.name;
// });
//
// console.log(nameList);

//TODO: Create your own array of (up to 3 and at least 2) restaurant objects building off of the basic list you created during the MapBox exercise (or build one anew!) ~5 mins

var favoriteRestaurants = [{
    name: "Fujiya Japanese Garden",
    address: "9030 Wurzbach Rd, San Antonio, TX 78240",
    dishes: "Takoyaki, Fujiya Sashimi Salad, Twin Dragon Roll, Chashu Ramen"
}, {
    name: "Sushihana Japanese Restaurant",
    address: "1810 NW Military Hwy, San Antonio, TX 78213",
    dishes: "Nigiri appertizer, Sushi & sashimi dinner, Assorted sashimi"
}, {
    name: "Hon Machi Korean BBQ",
    address: "8251 Agora Pkwy, Selma, TX 78154",
    dishes: "Spicy Baby Octopus, Bulgogi Beef, Ribeye Steak"
}];

//TODO: Now, having created a personal array of restaurant objects for yourself, use .map() to get your favorite restaurant's names out of that collection, into another array, and out into the console! ~5 mins

let favoriteRestaurantNames = favoriteRestaurants.map(restaurant => restaurant.name);

console.log(favoriteRestaurantNames);

//~ * Filter * ~

//TODO Together: Once again, let's take a look at the old way we might approach an issue: getting only one type of values out of an array (for example: even numbers only from an array of nums!)
//
// var evens = [];
// for (var i = 0; i < numbers.length; i += 1) {
//     if (numbers[i] % 2 === 0) {
//         evens.push(numbers[i]);
//     }
// }
// console.log(evens); // [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]

//TODO Together: Now, let's refactor the above using the ES6 .filter() method with the same goal: even numbers only!

let evens = numbers.filter(function (num) {
    return num % 2  === 0;
});

console.log(evens);

//TODO Together: Using my favoriteRestaurants list, let's filter out all of the non-buffet restaurants

//TODO: Each one of your restaurant arrays is unique, but, in that array, identify something to filter by - it could be as simple as "well, let me filter out all of the restaurants with names shorter than 8 characters" or get as complicated as you'd like!

let hasSashimi = favoriteRestaurants.filter( restaurant => restaurant.dishes.toLowerCase().includes("sashimi")
);

console.log(hasSashimi);

//TODO: Once you've done the above, go ahead and write the necessary code to achieve what you wanted - remember to practice with .filter() and our ES6 verbiage!

//~ * Reduce * ~

//Reduce is an interesting animal in and of itself: it's a way to reduce a collection down to, typically, a single value of some kind:

//TODO Together: Let's sum up some numbers with the .reduce() method and a number array!

let numbersArr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

// in the past: we would have built put a loop, probably used a var of sum, and had a look inside of the loop of sum += numbers[i], split out sum with the sum of our numbers

// in ES6 with .reduce(). .reduce() has a couple of components to it: .reduce(callbackFunction, initialValue)

let sum = numbersArr.reduce(function(total, num) {
    return total + num;
}, 0);

console.log(`Our numbers added up are ${sum}`);

//TODO Together: Let's take a step a bit deeper with .reduce() - .reduce()'s output can take many forms and shapes. For example, let's say we wanted to have a little Javascript that would count the length of the strings in an array and return that info back to us in an object. For example: ["Codeup", "San Antonio", "Dallas", "Marco Cohort", "ES6"] would get us: Object { Codeup: 6, San: 3, Antonio: 7, Dallas: 6, Marco: 5, Cohort: 6, ES6: 3 }

let stringArr = ["Codeup", "San", "Antonio", "Dallas", "Marco", "Cohort", "ES6"];

let strLengthObj = stringArr.reduce(function (objectProp, element) {
    objectProp[element] = element.length; // assign the length as a value of the property named element {elementName: elementLength}
    return objectProp;
}, {});

console.log(strLengthObj);

//TODO Together: That's pretty wild, eh! Wonder what else we could get up to with .reduce() - how about we make a function and use .reduce() inside of it? We'll write a function named countWords that takes a sentence in a single string. We need to split that sentence into an array and then write a .reduce() that would let us know how many times each word appeared in the string.

// function countWords(sentence) {
//     const words = sentence.split(' '); // transform a sentence into an array of words
//     const wordCountObject = words.reduce((wordCounts, word) => {
//         if (typeof wordCounts[word] === 'undefined') {
//             // if the word is not yet present in our object, set it's value to 1
//             wordCounts[word] = 1;
//         } else {
//             // otherwise increment the existing count
//             wordCounts[word] += 1;
//         }
//         return wordCounts;
//     }, {}); // start with an empty object
//     return wordCountObject;
// }

let sentence = "Mary had a little lamb , little lamb , little lamb";
countWords('Mary had a little lamb little lamb little lamb');
// {Mary: 1, had: 1, a: 1, little: 3, lamb: 3}
console.log(countWords(sentence));

//TODO Together: Pretty good, but do we want to count the number of times the comma is involved? If only we had a method that would .filter() - wait! Let's refactor the above function to do just that!

function countWords(sentence) {
    let words = sentence.split(' '); // transform a sentence into an array of words

    words = words.filter(word => word !== ",");

    const wordCountObject = words.reduce((wordCounts, word) => {
        if (typeof wordCounts[word] === 'undefined') {
            // if the word is not yet present in our object, set it's value to 1
            wordCounts[word] = 1;
        } else {
            // otherwise increment the existing count
            wordCounts[word] += 1;
        }
        return wordCounts;
    }, {}); // start with an empty object
    return wordCountObject;
}

console.log(countWords(sentence));

//TODO: Let's make a new array of objects to use - make an array of objects [{},{},{}] consisting of a number of family members as objects with their name and ages as properties. Use .reduce() to sum up the age of those family members and see what it is! e.g. [{name: "Thurston Howell III", age: 50}, {name: "William Dean Howells", age: 83}] would be 133 by adding those two age properties together (50 + 83).

const familyMembers = [
    {
        name: "Thurston Howell III",
        age: 50
    },{
        name: "William Dean Howells",
        age: 83
    },{
        name: "Fievel Howell",
        age: 7
    }
];

const agesInTotal = familyMembers.reduce((total, member) => (total + member.age), 0)

console.log(agesInTotal);
